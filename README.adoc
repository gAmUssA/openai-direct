= OpenAI Direct API Call Example
:toc:
:icons: font

This project demonstrates how to make a direct HTTP call to the OpenAI API using only standard Kotlin and Java libraries, *without* any frameworks like LangChain4j.

== How to Run

1. **Set your OpenAI API key** as an environment variable:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

2. **Build and run the script:**

    ./gradlew run

== What This Does

- Makes a POST request to OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, asking a question about airline loyalty programs.
- Prints the raw JSON response to the console.

== Using HTTPie and jq

If you prefer using command-line tools, you can achieve the same functionality with HTTPie and jq:

1. **Install the required tools** (if not already installed):

    # For macOS
    brew install httpie jq

    # For Ubuntu/Debian
    apt-get install httpie jq

2. **Make the API call with HTTPie**:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

    http POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
      "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      "Content-Type: application/json" \
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo" \
      messages:='[{"role": "user", "content": "What are the best ways to maximize airline loyalty program benefits?"}]'

3. **Process the response with jq** (optional):

    # To extract just the response content
    http POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
      "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      "Content-Type: application/json" \
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo" \
      messages:='[{"role": "user", "content": "What are the best ways to maximize airline loyalty program benefits?"}]' | \
      jq '.choices[0].message.content'

    # To pretty-print the entire response
    http POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
      "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      "Content-Type: application/json" \
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo" \
      messages:='[{"role": "user", "content": "What are the best ways to maximize airline loyalty program benefits?"}]' | \
      jq '.'

== Limitations of Direct API Calls

- *Boilerplate*: You must manually build JSON, handle HTTP, and parse responses.
- *No abstractions*: There's no type safety, retry logic, or error handling beyond what you write yourself.
- *Missing features*: No built-in streaming, prompt management, or advanced integrations that frameworks like LangChain4j provide.
- *Security*: You must manage API keys and secrets yourself.

== Why Use a Framework?

Frameworks like LangChain4j offer:
- Higher-level abstractions for prompt/response handling
- Built-in error handling, retries, and streaming
- Easier integration with other tools, databases, and chains
- More maintainable and readable code

== For demonstration only!
This script is intentionally minimal to highlight the *"naked"* nature of direct API calls.

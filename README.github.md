# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

The Git repository has been initialized locally with all necessary files. To push this to GitHub, please follow these steps:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., 'openai-direct')
   - Optionally add a description
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we've already created these)
   - Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openai-direct.git
```

## 3. Push your code to GitHub:
```
git push -u origin main
```

## Project Status
Your project is now ready with:
- Initialized Git repository
- Appropriate .gitignore for Kotlin/Gradle projects
- MIT License
- All project files committed

The steps above will publish your repository to GitHub.
